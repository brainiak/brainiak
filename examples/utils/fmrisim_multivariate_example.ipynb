    "\n",
    "A critical step in the fmrisim toolbox is determining the noise parameters of the volume to be created. Many noise parameters are available for specification and if any are not set then they will default to reasonable values. As before, it is instead possible to provide raw fMRI data that will be used to estimate these noise parameters. The goal of the noise estimation is to calculate general descriptive statistics about the noise in the brain that are thought to be important. The simulations are thought to be useful for understanding how signals will survive analyses when embedded in realistic neural noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the disclaimers: the values here are only an estimate and will depend on noise properties combining in the ways specified. In addition, because of the non-linearity and stochasticity of this simulation, this estimation is not fully invertible: if you generate a dataset with a set of noise parameters it will have similar but not the same noise parameters as a result. Moreover, complex interactions between brain regions that likely better describe brain noise are not modelled here: this toolbox pays no attention to regions of the brain or their interactions. Finally, for best results use raw fMRI because if the data has been preprocessed then assumptions this algorithm makes are likely to be erroneous. For instance, if the brain has been masked then this will eliminate variance in non-brain voxels which will mean that calculations of noise dependent on those voxels as a reference will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "This toolbox separates noise in two: spatial noise and temporal noise. To estimate spatial noise both the smoothness and the amount of non-brain noise of the data must be quantified. For smoothness, the Full Width Half Max (FWHM) of the volume is averaged for the X, Y and Z dimension and then averaged across a sample of time points. To calculate the Signal to Noise Ratio the mean activity in brain voxels for the middle time point is divided by the standard deviation in activity across non-brain voxels for that time point. For temporal noise the drift, temporal autocorrelation, and functional variability is estimated. The drift is estimated by averaging all non-brain voxels and looking at the variance in this average across time. This time course is also used to estimate the temporal autoregression by taking the first slope coefficient of an autoregression estimation function from the Nitime package . The Signal to Fluctuation Noise Ratio is calculated by dividing the average activity of voxels in the brain with that voxel’s noise  (Friedman & Glover, 2006). That noise is calculated by taking the standard deviation of that voxel over time after it has been detrended with a second order polynomial.  Other types of noise can be generated, such as physiological noise, but are not estimated by this function.\n"

A useful metric for this is the SFNR value determined from noise calculations because it can be used to estimate the variability in the average voxel. This is set up so that the evoked activity is proportional to the mean activity of a voxel. For a univariate effect, to estimate activity with a Cohen’s d of 1, the size of the change must be equivalent to one standard deviation. For multivariate effects the effect size depends on multiple factors including the number of voxels and conditions. Different measures for effect size could also be calculated, such as percent signal change. Note that that this signal change is based on the average voxel. Instead it might be preferable to model signal change based on the mean of each voxel (i.e. the template value)."

    "*3.1 Create temporal noise*\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal noise of fMRI data is comprised of multiple components: drift, autoregression, task related motion and physiological noise. To estimate drift, a sine wave with a default period of 300s, is used. To estimate drift, cosine basis functions are combined, with longer runs being comprised of more basis functions (Welvaert, et al., 2011). This drift is then multiplied by a three-dimensional volume of Gaussian random fields of a specific FWHM. Autoregression noise is estimated by creating a time course of Gaussian noise values that are weighted by previous values of the time course.  This autoregressive time course is multiplied by a brain shaped volume of Gaussian random fields. Physiological noise is modeled by sine waves comprised of heart rate (1.17Hz) and respiration rate (0.2Hz) (Biswal, et al., 1996) with random phase. This time course is also multiplied by brain shaped spatial noise. Finally, task related noise is simulated by adding Gaussian or Rician noise to time points where there are events (according to the event time course) and in turn this is multiplied by a brain shaped spatial noise volume. These four noise components are then mixed together in proportion to the size of their corresponding noise values. This aggregated volume is then Z scored and the SFNR is used to estimate the appropriate standard deviation of these values across time. "
