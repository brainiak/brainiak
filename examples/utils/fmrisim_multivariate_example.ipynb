One way to generate both of these volumes is the mask_brain function. At a minimum, this takes as an input the fMRI volume to be simulated. To create the template this volume is averaged over time and bounded to a range from 0 to 1. In other words, voxels with a high value in the template have high activity over time.

    "\n",
    "A critical step in the fmrisim toolbox is determining the noise parameters of the volume to be created. Many noise parameters are available for specification and if any are not set then they will default to reasonable values. As before, it is instead possible to provide raw fMRI data that will be used to estimate these noise parameters. The goal of the noise estimation is to calculate general descriptive statistics about the noise in the brain that are thought to be important. The simulations are thought to be useful for understanding how signals will survive analyses when embedded in realistic neural noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the disclaimers: the values here are only an estimate and will depend on noise properties combining in the ways specified. In addition, because of the non-linearity and stochasticity of this simulation, this estimation is not fully invertible: if you generate a dataset with a set of noise parameters it will have similar but not the same noise parameters as a result. Moreover, complex interactions between brain regions that likely better describe brain noise are not modelled here: this toolbox pays no attention to regions of the brain or their interactions. Finally, for best results use raw fMRI because if the data has been preprocessed then assumptions this algorithm makes are likely to be erroneous. For instance, if the brain has been masked then this will eliminate variance in non-brain voxels which will mean that calculations of noise dependent on those voxels as a reference will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "This toolbox separates noise in two: spatial noise and temporal noise. To estimate spatial noise both the smoothness and the amount of non-brain noise of the data must be quantified. For smoothness, the Full Width Half Max (FWHM) of the volume is averaged for the X, Y and Z dimension and then averaged across a sample of time points. To calculate the Signal to Noise Ratio the mean activity in brain voxels for the middle time point is divided by the standard deviation in activity across non-brain voxels for that time point. For temporal noise the drift, temporal autocorrelation, and functional variability is estimated. The drift is estimated by averaging all non-brain voxels and looking at the variance in this average across time. This time course is also used to estimate the temporal autoregression by taking the first slope coefficient of an autoregression estimation function from the Nitime package . The Signal to Fluctuation Noise Ratio is calculated by dividing the average activity of voxels in the brain with that voxel’s noise  (Friedman & Glover, 2006). That noise is calculated by taking the standard deviation of that voxel over time after it has been detrended with a second order polynomial.  Other types of noise can be generated, such as physiological noise, but are not estimated by this function.\n"

Several tools are supplied to help with different types of signal that may be required; however, custom scripts may be necessary for unique effects. Below an experiment will be simulated in which two conditions, A and B, evoke different patterns of activity in the same set of voxels in the brain. This pattern does not manifest as a univariate change in voxel activity across voxels but instead each condition evokes a consistent pattern across voxels. These conditions are randomly intermixed trial by trial. This code could be easily changed to instead compare univariate changes  evoked by stimuli in different brain regions. "

By default, convolve_hrf assumes a double gamma HRF appropriately models a brain’s response to events, as modeled by fMRI (Friston, et al., 1998). To do this, each voxel’s time course is convolved to make a function of the signal activity. Hence this produces an estimate of the voxel’s activity, after considering the temporal blurring of the HRF. This can take a single vector of events or multiple time courses."

    "*3.1 Create temporal noise*\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal noise of fMRI data is comprised of multiple components: drift, autoregression, task related motion and physiological noise. To estimate drift, a sine wave with a default period of 300s, is used. Although other simulators use a combination of discrete cosines for estimating drift (Welvaert, et al., 2011), our testing suggests that this provides poor estimates in long scans (>200s). This drift is then multiplied by a three-dimensional volume of Gaussian random fields of a specific FWHM. Autoregression noise is estimated by creating a time course of Gaussian noise values that are weighted by previous values of the time course.  This autoregressive time course is multiplied by a brain shaped volume of Gaussian random fields. Physiological noise is modeled by sine waves comprised of heart rate (1.17Hz) and respiration rate (0.2Hz) (Biswal, et al., 1996) with random phase. This time course is also multiplied by brain shaped spatial noise. Finally, task related noise is simulated by adding Gaussian or Rician noise to time points where there are events (according to the event time course) and in turn this is multiplied by a brain shaped spatial noise volume. These four noise components are then mixed together in proportion to the size of their corresponding noise values. This aggregated volume is then Z scored and the SFNR is used to estimate the appropriate standard deviation of these values across time. \n",
    "\t\n",
    "*3.2 Create system noise*\n",
    "    \n",
    "In addition to temporal noise from fluctuations in the scanner there is also machine noise that causes fluctuations in all voxels. When SNR is low, Rician noise is a good estimate of background noise data (Gudbjartsson, & Patz, 1995). From our testing, when SNR is higher than 30 then noise with an exponential distribution better describes the data. The SNR value that is supplied determines the standard deviation of this machine noise.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "*3.3 Combine noise and template*\n",
    "    \n",
    "The template volume is used to estimate the appropriate baseline distribution of MR values. This estimate is then combined with the temporal noise and the system noise to make an estimate of the noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "*3.4 Combine signal and noise*\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the brain signal is expected to be small and sparse relative to the noise, it is assumed sufficient to simply add the volume containing signal with the volume modeling noise to make the simulated brain. \n"
