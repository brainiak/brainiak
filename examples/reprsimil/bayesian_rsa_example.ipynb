    "# This demo shows how to use the Bayesian Representational Similarity Analysis method in brainiak with a simulated dataset.\n",
    "### The brainik.reprsimil.brsa module has two estimators named BRSA and GBRSA. Both of them can be used to estimate representational similarity from a single participant, but with some differences in the assumptions of the models and fitting procedure. The basic usages are similar. We now generally recommend using GBRSA over BRSA for most of the cases. This document shows how to use BRSA for most of the part. At the end of the document, the usage of GBRSA is shown as well. You are encouranged to go through the example and try both estimators for your data.\n",

    "The design matrix reflects your belief of how fMRI signal should respond to a task (if a voxel does respond).\n",
    "The common assumption is that a neural event that you are interested in will elicit a slow hemodynamic response in some voxels. The response peaks around 4-6 seconds after the event onset and dies down more than 12 seconds after the event. Therefore, typically you convolve a time series A, composed of delta (stem) functions reflecting the time of each neural event belonging to the same category (e.g. all trials in which a participant sees a face), with a hemodynamic response function B, to form the hypothetic response of any voxel to such type of neural event.\n",
    "For each type of event, such a convoluted time course can be generated. These time courses, put together, are called design matrix, reflecting what we believe a temporal signal would look like, if it exists in any voxel.\n",
    "Our goal is to figure out how the (spatial) response pattern of a population of voxels (in an Region of Interest, ROI) are similar or disimilar to different types of tasks (e.g., watching face vs. house, watching different categories of animals, different conditions of a cognitive task). So we need the design matrix in order to estimate the similarity matrix we are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the utility called ReadDesign in brainiak.utils to read a design matrix generated from AFNI. For design matrix saved as Matlab data file by SPM or or other toolbox, you can use scipy.io.loadmat('YOURFILENAME') and extract the design matrix from the dictionary returned. Basically, the Bayesian RSA in this toolkit just needs a numpy array which is in size of {time points} * {condition}\n",
    "You can also generate design matrix using the function gen_design which is in brainiak.utils. It takes in (name of) event timing files in AFNI or FSL format (denoting onsets, duration, and weight for each event belongning to the same condition) and outputs the design matrix as numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical fMRI analysis, some nuisance regressors such as head motion, baseline time series and slow drift are also entered into regression. In using our method, you should not include such regressors into the design matrix, because the spatial spread of such nuisance regressors might be quite different from the spatial spread of task related signal. Including such nuisance regressors in design matrix might influence the pseudo-SNR map, which in turn influence the estimation of the shared covariance matrix. \n",
