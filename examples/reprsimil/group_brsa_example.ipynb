    "## When analyzing an ROI of hundreds to thousands voxels, it is expected to be faster than the non-group version BRSA (refer to the other example). The reason is that GBRSA marginalize the SNR and AR(1) coefficient parameters of each voxel by numerical integration, thus eliminating hundreds to thousands of free parameters and reducing computation. However, if you are doing searchlight analysis with tens of voxels in each searchlight, it is possible that BRSA is faster.\n",

    "## Load an example design matrix.\n",
    "The user should prepare their design matrix with their favorate software, such as using 3ddeconvolve of AFNI, or using SPM or FSL.\n",
    "The design matrix reflects your belief of how fMRI signal should respond to a task (if a voxel does respond).\n",
    "The common assumption is that a neural event that you are interested in will elicit a slow hemodynamic response in some voxels. The response peaks around 4-6 seconds after the event onset and dies down more than 12 seconds after the event. Therefore, typically you convolve a time series A, composed of delta (stem) functions reflecting the time of each neural event belonging to the same category (e.g. all trials in which a participant sees a face), with a hemodynamic response function B, to form the hypothetic response of any voxel to such type of neural event.\n",
    "For each type of event, such a convoluted time course can be generated. These time courses, put together, are called design matrix, reflecting what we believe a temporal signal would look like, if it exists in any voxel.\n",
    "Our goal is to figure out how the (spatial) response pattern of a population of voxels (in an Region of Interest, ROI) are similar or disimilar to different types of tasks (e.g., watching face vs. house, watching different categories of animals, different conditions of a cognitive task). So we need the design matrix in order to estimate the similarity matrix we are interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the utility called ReadDesign from brainiak.utils to read a design matrix generated from AFNI. For design matrix saved as Matlab data file by SPM or or other toolbox, you can use scipy.io.loadmat('YOURFILENAME') and extract the design matrix from the dictionary returned. Basically, the Bayesian RSA in this toolkit just needs a numpy array which is in size of {time points} * {condition}\n",
    "You can also generate design matrix using the function gen_design which is in brainiak.utils. It takes in (names of) event timing files in AFNI or FSL format (denoting onsets, duration, and weight for each event belongning to the same condition) and outputs the design matrix as numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In typical fMRI analysis, some nuisance regressors such as head motion, baseline time series and slow drift are also entered into regression. In using our method, you should not include such regressors into the design matrix, because the spatial spread of such nuisance regressors might be quite different from the spatial spread of task related signal. Including such nuisance regressors in design matrix might influence the pseudo-SNR map, which in turn influence the estimation of the shared covariance matrix. But you may include motion time course in the nuisance parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We concatenate the design matrix by 2 to 3 times, mimicking 2 to 3 runs of identical timing\n",
    "### Note that different subjects do not have to have the same number of voxels or time points. The timing of the task conditions of them can also differ. The simulation below reflects this\n"
