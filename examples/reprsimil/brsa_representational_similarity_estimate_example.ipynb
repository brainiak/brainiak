    "The design matrix reflects your belief of how fMRI signal should respond to a task (if a voxel does respond).\n",
    "The common assumption is that a neural event that you are interested in will elicit a slow hemodynamic response in some voxels. The response peaks around 4-6 seconds after the event onset and dies down more than 12 seconds after the event. Therefore, typically you convolve a time series A, composed of delta (stem) functions reflecting the time of each neural event belonging to the same category (e.g. all trials in which a participant sees a face), with a hemodynamic response function B, to form the hypothetic response of any voxel to such type of neural event.\n",
    "For each type of event, such a convoluted time course can be generated. These time courses, put together, are called design matrix, reflecting what we believe a temporal signal would look like, if it exists in any voxel.\n",
    "Our goal is to figure out how the (spatial) response pattern of a population of voxels (in an Region of Interest, ROI) are similar or disimilar to different types of tasks (e.g., watching face vs. house, watching different categories of animals, different conditions of a cognitive task). So we need the design matrix in order to estimate the similarity matrix we are interested.\n",

    "We can use the utility called ReadDesign to read a design matrix generated from AFNI. For design matrix saved as Matlab data file by SPM or or other toolbox, you can use scipy.io.loadmat('YOURFILENAME') and extract the design matrix from the dictionary returned. Basically, the Bayesian RSA in this toolkit just needs a numpy array which is in size of {time points} * {condition}\n",

    "In typical fMRI analysis, some nuisance regressors such as head motion, baseline time series and slow drift are also entered into regression. In using our method, you should not include such regressors into the design matrix, because the spatial spread of such nuisance regressors might be quite different from the spatial spread of task related signal. Including such nuisance regressors in design matrix might influence the pseudo-SNR map, which in turn influence the estimation of the shared covariance matrix. \n",

    "Apparently one can imagine that the choice of the number of principal components used as nuisance regressors can influence the result. If you just choose 1 or 2, perhaps only the baseline and drift would be captured. But including too many nuisance regressors would slow the fitting speed and might have risk of overfitting. The users might consider starting in the range of 5-20. In future, we may consider using cross validation to determine the number of nuisance regressors, similar as in GLMdenoise (http://kendrickkay.net/GLMdenoise/)"
