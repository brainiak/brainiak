    "# Implementing a Real-Time fMRI Cloud-Based Framework\n",
    "\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook walks through an example using our cloud-based software framework for real-time fMRI studies, henceforth referred to as **rtcloud framework**. We have created a sample script (sample.py) in this notebook directory which builds a two-class classifier on a region of interest (ROI). This notebook will generate synthetic data for training and classification using the BrainIAK fmrisim_real_time_generator function. **Readers who are interested in running full-scale real-time fMRI studies using this framework should refer to the main [RT-Cloud Repo](https://github.com/brainiak/rt-cloud)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin wrapping the sample.py script within the rtcloud projectInterface. In a normal deployment the projectInterface (and sample.py) would then run in the cloud and the scanner images would be sent to the cloud where our sample.py script would build the classifier model and do classification. The projectInterface handles remote file communication for reading the scanner images and providing the classification results. It also has a web-based user interface for viewing and controlling the experiment and changing settings. In this notebook the different process all run on the the computer that jupyter is running on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steps below, we will first start the projectInterface which will watch for dicom files to process. We will then start the synthetic data generator which will generate a new dicom image every 2 seconds. And finally we will start a web browser within this notebook for controlling the experiment. Once you start the web interface you can click the 'Run' button to start the sample.py script watching for and processing images via the projectInterface. (You can also open the web interface on a different tab in your browser, http://localhost:8889.)\n",
