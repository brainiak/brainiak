The Brain Imaging Analysis Kit is a package of Python modules useful for
neuroscience, primarily focused on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
analysis.

The package was originally created by a collaboration between Intel and the
Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI).

To reduce verbosity, we may refer to the Brain Imaging Analysis Kit using the
``BrainIAK`` abbreviation. Whenever lowercase spelling is used (e.g., Python
package name), we use ``brainiak``.


Quickstart
==========

You can install BrainIAK wheels from PyPI on Linux, macOS, and Windows, e.g. using pip::

    python3 -m pip install brainiak

If you need MPI, see the installation requirements in `docs/installation`.

If you have `Conda <conda.io>`_, you can also use our Conda packages (not available for Windows). Installing BrainIAK will also install MPI::

    conda install -c brainiak -c conda-forge brainiak


Docker
======

You can also test BrainIAK without installing it using Docker::

    docker pull brainiak/brainiak
    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v brainiak:/mnt --name demo brainiak/brainiak

To run Jupyter notebooks in the running container, try::

    python3 -m notebook --allow-root --no-browser --ip=0.0.0.0

Then visit http://localhost:8888 in your browser and enter the token. Protip:
run ``screen`` before running the notebook command.

Note that we do not support MPI execution using Docker containers and that performance will not be optimal.


Support
=======

If you have a question or feedback, chat with us on `Matrix via Gitter
<https://gitter.im/brainiak/brainiak>`_ or email our list at
brainiak@googlegroups.com. If you find a problem with BrainIAK, you can also
`open an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak/issues>`_.


Examples
========

We include BrainIAK usage examples in the examples directory of the code
repository, e.g., `funcalign/srm_image_prediction_example.ipynb
<https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak/blob/master/examples/funcalign/srm_image_prediction_example.ipynb>`_.

To run the examples, download an archive of the `latest BrainIAK release from
GitHub <https://github.com/brainiak/brainiak/releases>`_. Note that we only
support the latest release at this moment, so make sure to upgrade your
BrainIAK installation.
