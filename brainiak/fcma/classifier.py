class Classifier(BaseEstimator):
    """Correlation-based classification component of FCMA

    The classifier first computes correlation of the input data,
    and normalizes them if needed, then uses the given classifier
    to train and/or predict the correlation data.
    NOTE: if the classifier is sklearn.svm.SVC with precomputed kernel,
    the test data may be provided in the fit method to compute
    the kernel matrix together with the training data to save the memory usage,
    but the test data will NEVER be seen in the model training.

    Parameters
    ----------

    clf: class
        The classifier used, normally a classifier class of sklearn

    num_processed_voxels: int, default 2000
        Used for SVM with precomputed kernel,
        every time it only computes correlation between num_process_voxels and
        the whole mask to aggregate the kernel matrices.
        This is to save the memory
        so as to handle correlations at a larger scale.

    epochs_per_subj: int, default 0
        The number of epochs of each subject
        within-subject normalization will be performed during
        classifier training if epochs_per_subj is specified
        default 0 means no within-subject normalization


    Attributes
    ----------

    training_data_: 2D numpy array in shape [num_samples, num_features]
        training_data\\_ is None except clf is SVM.SVC with precomputed kernel,
        in which case training data is needed to compute
        the similarity vector for each sample to be classified.
        However, if the test samples are also provided during the fit,
        the similarity vectors can be precomputed too
        and then training_data\\_ is None

    test_raw_data_: a list of 2D array in shape [num_TRs, num_voxels]
        default None
        test_raw_data\\_ is set after a prediction is called,
        if the new input data equals test_raw_data\\_,
        test_data\\_ can be reused

    test_data_: 2D numpy array in shape [num_samples, num_features]
        default None
        test_data\\_ is set after a prediction is called,
        so that the test data does not need to be regenerated in the
        subsequent operations, e.g. getting decision values of the prediction.
        test_data\\_ may also be set in the fit method
        if sklearn.svm.SVC with precomputed kernel
        and the test samples are known.
        NOTE: the test samples will never be used to fit the model.

    num_voxels_: int
        The number of voxels of the first brain region used in the classifier.
        The first brain region is always large. When training, this region may
        be divided to compute the correlation portion by portion.
        The brain regions are defined by the applied mask, e.g. the top voxels
        selected by FCMA voxel selection

    num_features_: int
        The dimension of correlation data, normally is the product of
        the number of voxels of brain region 1 and
        the number of voxels of brain region 2.
        num_features\\_ must be consistent in both training and classification

    num_samples_: int
        The number of samples

    num_digits_: int
        The number of digits of the first value of the kernel matrix,
        for normalizing the kernel values accordingly
