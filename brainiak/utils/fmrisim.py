"""fMRI Simulator

Simulate fMRI data for a single subject.

This code provides a set of functions necessary to produce realistic
simulations of neural data.

Steps:

generate_signal
Specify the volume (or volumes) which represent the signal in the neural data.

generate_stimfunction
Create a function to describe the stimulus onsets/durations

export_stimfunction:
Generate a three column timing file that can be used with software like FSL

double_gamma_hrf
Convolve the stimulus function with the HRF to model when events are expected.

apply_signal
Combine the volume and the HRF

calc_noise
Estimate the noise properties of a given volume

generate_noise
Create the noise for this run. This creates temporal, task and white noise.
Various parameters can be tuned depending on need

mask_brain
Mask the volume to look like a volume. Based on MNI standard space

plot_brain
Show the brain as it unfolds over time with a given opacity.

        This is approximate for two reasons: firstly, although the
        distribution that is being drawn from is set to this value,
        this will manifest differently on every draw. Secondly, because of
        the masking and dimensions of the generated volume, this does not
        behave simply. For instance, values over 10 do not work well because
        the size of the volume. Moreover, wrapping effects matter (the
        outputs are closer to this value if you have no mask).
